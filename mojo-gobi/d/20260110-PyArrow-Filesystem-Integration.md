20260110 - PyArrow Filesystem Integration in Blob Storage
- Migrated BlobStorage from direct file operations to PyArrow filesystem interface
- Replaced os.path operations with pyarrow.fs.LocalFileSystem for cross-platform compatibility
- Updated write_blob to use fs.open_output_stream with proper UTF-8 encoding
- Updated read_blob to use fs.open_input_stream with UTF-8 decoding
- Modified write_blob_binary and read_blob_binary to use PyArrow streams for binary data
- Replaced os.remove with fs.delete_file for blob deletion
- Implemented list_blobs using fs.get_file_info with FileSelector for recursive directory traversal
- Updated blob_exists to use fs.get_file_info for file existence checking
- Maintained Azure ADLS Gen 2 compatibility patterns while leveraging PyArrow's filesystem abstraction
- Resolved Mojo compilation issues with proper PythonObject conversions for encoding/decoding
- Build succeeds with PyArrow filesystem integration, maintaining all existing functionality
- Blob storage now uses industry-standard PyArrow filesystem interface for better portability and features
