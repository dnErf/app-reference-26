# Done Tasks

- Built a pure Mojo CLI tool called 'gobi' for AI project management, similar to uv but stricter.
- Implemented commands: version, help, init, run, validate, sync, build, add, remove.
- Used interactive input via Python interop to set sys.argv dynamically.
- Tested functionality: init creates project structure, validate checks validity, build creates executable.
- Achieved pure Mojo implementation without separate Python script.
