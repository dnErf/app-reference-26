- Create in-depth example for Mojo parameters: demonstrate compile-time parameterization concepts from https://docs.modular.com/mojo/manual/parameters/ including parameterized functions, structs, comptime values, parameter inference, infer-only parameters, and variadic parameters.
- Set up virtual environment in mojo-le folder if not exists.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Install Mojo package (use pip install mojo or appropriate installation method).
- Create an intermediate level Mojo example: demonstrate structs, functions, error handling, and basic memory management.
- Create an advanced level Mojo example: demonstrate traits, generics, async/await, memory ownership, and expert features.
- Test both examples to ensure they compile and run correctly.
