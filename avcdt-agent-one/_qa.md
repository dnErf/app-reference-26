# QA Review Checklist

This checklist is owned by **QA**. QA may approve and merge changes once the checklist items are satisfied — no additional approval needed unless explicitly requested.

- [ ] Specs present and valid (owner/tester) — `specs/<name>.json` and `specs/examples/` exist
- [ ] _Plan updated (`_plan.md`)_
- [ ] Implementation done (developer)
- [ ] Tests added and passing (tester)
- [ ] Tester reviewed and marked tests as approved
- [ ] Manual QA verification (core flows) performed
- [ ] Accessibility/basic UX checked
- [ ] Documentation/AGENTS.md updated if needed

Notes:
- If a change risks production, QA may request further review from the owner/architect.
- QA is empowered to approve and merge when checklist is complete.
